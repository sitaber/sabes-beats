# Welcome
This page conatins links to several playlist of 'beats' that I made from 2020-2022 (aka pandemic beats).
Each list has a breif description of the style/content, and links to a styled player. If, for some reason, the styled player doesnt show up or if non-functional, there is a link at the bottom of the page that will display the default audio player supported by your browser. The playlist will than default to a simple ordered list with clickable links.

## Bithop
Beats made using samples from old video games (think NES,atari, GameBoy etc) or the sythns used to made the sounds for the game. Gritty, Bit Crushed, audiophonic experiance

## Chill-Fi
Laid back beats for the most part. My take on "LOFI" styled beats (meme and all). All beats were made utilizing Ableton Live 10 Lite Stock plugins and a few Third-pary VST/FX. THese were attempts to learn some music theory, so all chords, notes etc are played by me form my computer keyboard
